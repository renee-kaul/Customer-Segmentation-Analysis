# Customer Segment Analysis

## The customer segment analysis was perfomed on open source datasets. There were two datasets used- Customer Data and Transaction Data
## Both the datasets were cleaned and an Exploratory Data Analysis was performed on both.
## They were merged and statistical tests along with an RFM analysis was performed on them to segment the customers
## Customer segments were segmented into 5 types:
  ### Top Customers
  ### High value Customer
  ### Medium Value Customer
  ### Low Value Customers
  ### Lost Customers
## These segments were visualised for the purposes of presentation and analysis.
